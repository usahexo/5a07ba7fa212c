#  Nevada Legalized Gambling in 1931

In 1931, the state of Nevada legalized gambling, making it one of the first states to do so. This event helped to shape the landscape of Sin City and bring in tourists from all over the world. While Las Vegas is often thought of as being the gambling capital of the US, Reno actually has a larger casino industry.

Nevada's decision to legalize gambling was largely influenced by its climate and geography. With its wide-open spaces and rugged landscape, Nevada provided the perfect setting for casinos and other forms of gambling. In addition, tourism was a major industry in Nevada at the time, and legalizing gambling helped to attract more visitors to the state.

Today, Nevada's gaming industry is worth an estimated $25 billion. This makes it one of the most lucrative gambling destinations in the world. In addition to casinos, Nevada also has a thriving riverboat gaming industry.

#  New Jersey Legalized Gambling in 1976

In 1976, New Jersey legalized gambling in an effort to bring more economic activity to the state. At the time, Atlantic City was a struggling coastal resort town. The new law allowed for casinos to be built there, and the first one opened its doors in 1978.

The original casinos were small, with only a few dozen tables and machines. Over the years, as neighboring states legalized gambling as well, Atlantic City's casinos grew in size and complexity. By 2006, there were twelve casinos operating in the city, and they generated over $5 billion in revenue annually.

However, the casino boom eventually went bust. Competition from newly-opened casinos in other states led to a decline in revenue for Atlantic City's casinos, and several of them closed their doors between 2014 and 2016. The remaining casinos are now struggling to stay afloat.

Nonetheless, legal gambling remains a key part of New Jersey's economy. In 2016, the state's gambling industry generated over $2.5 billion in revenue and employed nearly 30,000 people.

#  Connecticut Legalized Gambling in 1993

In 1993, the state of Connecticut legalized gambling. This was a turning point for the state, as it allowed for the development of casinos and other forms of gambling. The move was controversial at the time, but has proven to be a wise decision in the long run.

Since legalizing gambling, Connecticut has seen significant economic growth. In particular, the casino industry has flourished, with several casinos opening up in the state. This has created jobs and generated revenue for the state government.

Critics of gambling often argue that it leads to addiction and other social problems. However, there is evidence that this is not always the case. In fact, in some cases gambling can be beneficial for society as a whole.

It is clear that Connecticut made the right decision when it legalized gambling back in 1993. The industry has generated revenue and jobs for the state, and it has been good for the overall economy.

#  Pennsylvania legalized gambling in 2004

Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize gambling in 2004. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board was established in order to regulate and license the casinos. There are now 12 casinos in operation, and they brought in over $1.4 billion in revenue in 2017.

The first casino to open was Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in 2006. It is owned by the Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut and offers both slot machines and table games. Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course was the next casino to open, in 2007. It is owned by Penn National Gaming and offers slot machines, table games, and a racetrack.

The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem opened in 2009. It is owned by Las Vegas Sands Corporation and offers a casino, hotel, spa, and concert venue. The newest casino to open is Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin, which debuted in 2017. It is owned by Boyd Gaming Corporation and offers slot machines and table games.

# Gambling revenue has been increasing

Revenue from gambling has been on the rise since it was legalized in 2004. In 2017, the 12 casinos brought in a total of $1.4 billion in revenue. This was an increase of 3% from 2016, when casinos brought in $1.37 billion in revenue. The increase was due largely to growth at Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin and Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.

# Casinos employ thousands of people

The casinos employ thousands of people directly, and many more indirectly through services such as food and beverage sales, construction, and security. In 2017, the 12 casinos employed 18,873 people full-time and 2,023 part-time. This was an increase of 2% from 2016, when casinos employed 18,491 people full-time and 1,975 part-time.
