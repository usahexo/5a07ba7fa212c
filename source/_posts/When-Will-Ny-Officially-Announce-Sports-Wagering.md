#  When Will Ny Officially Announce Sports Wagering?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as the New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) has not released any information about an impending announcement regarding sports wagering. However, there are some clues that may give us an idea about when we can expect such news from NYSGC.

First and foremost, it's important to understand that the NYSGC was one of the first gaming commissions in the United States to authorize sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in May 2018 that overturned the federal ban on sports wagering. Since that time, other states have followed suit, but New York has been taking its time in drafting regulations for potential sports betting operators.

In June 2018, just a few weeks after the SCOTUS ruling, NYSGC issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input from potential sports betting providers about what they would want from a regulatory framework in New York. The RFI consisted of 57 questions related to everything from licensing requirements to consumer protection measures. In December 2018, NYSGC held a hearing in Albany to get feedback from industry stakeholders on the RFI.

Since then, there hasn't been much news from NYSGC on the progress of developing regulations for sports wagering. In January 2019, Gary Pretlow, Chairman of the Assembly's Racing and Wagering Committee, stated that he expected regulations to be issued by March 2019. However, that deadline came and went with no announcement from NYSGC.

More recently, there have been reports that NYSGC is close to issuing proposed regulations but is still working out some details related to consumer protection measures. It's unclear exactly what those details are, but it seems that NYSGC is taking its time to get things right before issuing any final regulations.

So when will we finally hear something from NYSGC about their plans for sports wagering? It's difficult to say for certain, but my best guess would be sometime within the next few months. They've been slowly teasing us with tidbits of information over the past year and I think they'll want to make a big splash with an official announcement once all of the details are finalized. Stay tuned!

#  When Will New York Casinos Be Able To Offer Sports Wagering?

When will sports betting be legalized in the state of New York? That is a question that many people have been asking, especially in light of the recent Supreme Court decision striking down the federal ban on sports wagering. However, it is still not clear when or how New York will go about legalizing and regulating sports betting.

In order for a casino in New York to offer sports betting, the state legislature would need to pass a bill authorizing it. There are currently several bills pending in the state legislature that would do just that. One of these bills, S5302, was introduced by Senator John Bonacic in June. It would allow any casino in New York to offer sports betting, including tribal casinos and racetracks. The bill has gained support from both Republicans and Democrats and is currently pending before the Senate Racing and Wagering Committee.

Another bill, A11734, was introduced by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow in July. This bill would allow only certain casinos in New York to offer sports betting, including those located in the Albany, Catskills, Hudson Valley, and Southern Tier regions of the state. This bill has also gained bipartisan support and is currently pending before the Assembly Standing Committee on Racing and Wagering.

It is still too early to say which of these bills will eventually be passed into law, but it seems likely that some form of legalization will eventually happen. In light of the Supreme Court decision, it is becoming increasingly difficult for states to deny their citizens the right to bet on sports.

#  Officials Weighing Options For sports Betting In New York 

After the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that banned sports betting outside of Nevada, officials in New York are weighing their options for implementing such a system within the state.

New York State Assemblyman Gary Pretlow says he is drafting legislation that would authorize sports betting in the state, and Governor Andrew Cuomo has expressed support for the idea. However, the details of how such a system would be implemented remain to be seen.

One option that is being considered is whether to allow licensed casinos in New York to offer sports betting, or whether to create a new agency to oversee sports betting. Another question is how much tax revenue the state could expect to collect from sports betting.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting argue that it would bring new revenue to the state, and that it would be a way to keep gambling dollars within New York rather than having them flow to other states. They also argue that it would be a way to help crackdown on illegal gambling operations.

Opponents of legalization contend that it could lead to increased problem gambling, and could also have negative implications for professional and collegiate sports organizations.

The details of any proposed legislation in New York are likely to be contentious, as there are divergent views on both the benefits and risks associated with legalized sports betting. However, with many states now moving to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court decision, it is clear that this is an issue that is gaining momentum nationwide.

#  Sports Betting Appears Heading To New York Casinos 

The New York State Gaming Commission has given the green light to six new casinos, with sports betting included, in the Southern Tier, Albany, Catskills, Southern Tier West and the East End of Long Island.

While horse racing and video lottery terminals are currently legal in New York State, this will be the first time that full-fledged casinos will be open for business. The bill was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2013 and it looks like it is finally coming to fruition.

According to Reuters, “the commission said it authorized licenses for two resorts in the Catskills and one each in the Finger Lakes, Schenectady-Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier West and East End of Long Island. It also authorized a license for a sixth location that has not yet been determined.” So as things stand now, there are six potential casino destinations that could offer sports betting.

This has been a long time coming for those who have pushed for legalized sports gambling in New York. The state is finally starting to catch up with the rest of the country when it comes to wagering on sporting events. And while some may say that this move is only going to lead to more gambling addiction problems, I think that it is a positive development overall.

It’s hard to argue with the money that can be made from legalized sports betting. Not only does it give people another form of entertainment, but it also provides a way for casinos to bring in more revenue. And as we all know, casino owners love to make money!

Of course, there are some risks associated with sports betting and I don’t want to downplay those in any way. But I believe that those risks are worth taking considering all of the potential benefits. Casinos are already very popular destinations and I think that adding sports betting options will only make them even more popular.

It will be interesting to see which casinos ultimately offer sports betting services and what kind of lines they will offer on various sporting events. I suspect that we will see some pretty tight odds on big games such as the Super Bowl or the World Series. But at the same time, there will likely be some opportunities to make money by betting on underdog teams as well.

So mark your calendars – November 2018 is when things are set to start happening in terms of legalized sports betting in New York!

#  When Will New Yorkers Finally be able to Place Bets on Their Favorite Teams?

"We expect to be up and running in the next few weeks."

That was the statement made by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in early November, regarding the long-awaited expansion of legalized sports betting in the state.

However, a month later and there's still no sign of when bets will actually be able to be placed.

So what's the hold-up?

Apparently, it's a combination of issues that need to be sorted out before sports betting can go ahead.

These include negotiating agreements with the major professional sports leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL), as well as finalizing regulations and licensing procedures.

In addition, there are also concerns about how the legalization of sports betting will impact the existing gambling industry in New York.

Cuomo has said that he's confident everything will be in place by the end of the year, but that remains to be seen.
