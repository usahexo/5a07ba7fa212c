#  Will the video be shot on film or videotape?
Movies used to be filmed on film, but now they're often videotaped. Which is better?



There is no definitive answer to this question as both film and videotape have their own advantages and disadvantages. Some people argue that film looks more natural and gives a feeling of reality, while others believe that videotape is more realistic because it captures movement more smoothly. Additionally, film can be more expensive to shoot than videotape, while videotape may require additional editing before it can be aired or shown in a movie theater.

#  What kind of fonts will be used in the titles and credits?

There are a few different fonts that can be used in the titles and credits of a movie. The type of font that is used often depends on the era in which the movie is set. Some older movies will use a typeface such as Old English, while more modern films might use something like Times New Roman.

Another consideration is how the font looks on screen. Some fonts are designed to be used in print, while others look better when displayed on a computer or television screen. There are also fonts that have been specifically designed for movie titles and credits.

For example, the typeface Trajan is often used in Hollywood movies because it looks both elegant and expensive. Another popular font for movies is called Bebas Neue, which has a contemporary look and feel.

#  Will the commercial feature a jingle or song?

There is no one answer to this question as it will depend on the marketing and advertising agency who creates the commercial. Some agencies prefer to use famous songs or jingles in their commercials, while others create custom music specifically for the ad. There is no surefire way to know which route the commercial will take, but it will undoubtedly be an exciting and memorable experience for viewers.

#  What scenes will be used in the ad?

A popular question that arises during movie production is what scenes will be used in the ad. Studios typically want to use the most exciting and impactful clips in order to generate hype for the film and convince audiences to buy tickets. However, what scenes make it into the final cut can be a contentious issue, as there are often clashes between the director’s vision and the studio’s desire for a more commercially appealing product.

One recent example of this is Ridley Scott’s “The Martian”. The studio wanted to use a scene in which Matt Damon’s character, Mark Watney, is shown talking to a group of scientists back on Earth. However, Scott felt that this was unnecessary and preferred to keep the focus on the dramatic events taking place on Mars. As a result, this scene was not used in the final ad campaign.

Another dispute arose over a scene involving a sequence where Watney has to run away from a dust storm. The studio wanted to use this scene as it was seen as an impressive visual effects sequence. However, Scott felt that it was out of place in the film and reversed its order with another scene. This change caused concern among some fans, who felt that it betrayed the original book upon which the movie was based.

Despite these disputes, “The Martian” was still a commercial success, grossing over $630 million at the box office. This shows that, even if certain scenes are cut from ads, a good movie can still find an audience if it is marketed effectively.

#  Who will appear in the commercial?

The commercial will feature both a current and former NFL player. 

The current player will be a star quarterback who is in the middle of his career. The former player will be a legendary running back who has now retired. 

Both players will be shown interacting with each other and with fans. They will also be shown doing various activities together, such as playing football or working out in the gym. 

Throughout the commercial, the message that viewers should “stick with us” will be repeated. This implies that by supporting the NFL, they are supporting their favorite players and teams. 

# Why are these specific players featured?

The quarterback is featured because he is one of the most popular players in the NFL right now. He is also an excellent role model for younger fans. The running back is featured because he is a legendary figure in NFL history. He is someone that all fans can look up to and learn from. 

# What do these players represent?

The quarterback represents the present of the NFL. He is a talented player who is loved by many fans. The running back represents the past of the NFL. He was an incredible player in his day, and remains a revered figure among many fans. 

Together, these players represent the entire history of the NFL. They illustrate how far the league has come, and how it continues to evolve year after year.
