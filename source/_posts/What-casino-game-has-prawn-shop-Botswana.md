#  Casino game with prawn shop Botswana revealed!

A casino game with a prawn shop in Botswana has been revealed to the public. The game is called "Prawn Wars" and it is a strategy game that can be played by up to four players. In the game, each player starts with five prawns and the goal is to be the last player with prawns remaining.

The gameplay is simple - players take turns moving their prawns one space at a time. If a player's prawn lands on an opponent's prawn, then that opponent's prawn is captured and removed from the board. The first player to lose all of their prawns loses the game.

There are some additional rules that make the game more challenging. For example, if a player's prawn lands on a square with a Shop symbol, they can purchase an item from the shop. There are six items available in the shop, and each item has a different effect on the gameplay. For example, the Shield item protects your prawn from being captured, while the Bomb item automatically captures all of your opponent's prawns if used correctly.

The game also includes a bank where players can deposit or withdraw money. The bank can be used to purchase items from the shop, or to pay for opponent's prawns that have been captured.

The game was created by Julien Breban and it is currently available for free download on iOS and Android devices.

#  Uncover the mysteries of the casino game with prawn shop Botswana!

The casino game of prawn shop is one that often baffles novice players with its seemingly complex rules and strategic options. However, with a bit of study and some practice, it's possible to unlock the mysteries of this intriguing game and start winning big!

To begin with, it's important to understand the different types of prawns that are available in the game. There are three basic types: green, brown and red. Green prawns are weakest, while red prawns are the strongest. Players can either keep all their prawns together as a set or mix them up in order to create different combinations.

In addition, there are also three card colours: black, blue and red. These correspond to the different prawn colours, with black cards being weak and red cards being strong. Again, players can mix up their cards to create different combinations.

When it comes to playing the game, there are two key strategies: collection and blocking. Collection involves gathering as many of one particular type of prawn as possible, while blocking involves preventing your opponent from collecting specific types of prawns.

There are also a number of other strategic moves that can be made in order to gain an advantage over your opponent. For example, you can swap two cards with each other in order to change their colour; or you can place a card next to an opponent's card in order to block them from collecting any more prawns of that colour.

With a little bit of practice, you'll be able to become a master at playing prawn shop Botswana!
