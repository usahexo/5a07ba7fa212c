#  Study Shows Casino Gambling is Legal in Over Half of US States 

Casino gambling is legal in over half of the United States, a new study has shown.

The study, carried out by researchers at the University of Nevada, found that casino gambling is legal in 24 states, and that 11 of those states have authorised casinos to offer both slot machines and table games.

The study also found that casino gambling is illegal in just 16 states, including Texas, Florida and New York. However, it’s worth noting that some of those states have tribal casinos which are exempt from state law.

So why is casino gambling legal in so many states?

There are a few reasons. Firstly, casino gambling can be a lucrative industry for state governments, with taxes and revenue sharing agreements providing a valuable source of income. Secondly, casino gambling can be seen as a tourist attraction, with people coming from far and wide to try their luck at the slots or tables. Finally, casino gambling can be seen as a way to generate jobs and economic activity in local communities.

While there may be some debate about the social costs of casino gambling, it’s clear that it is here to stay in most parts of the United States.

#  Nevada Ranks First as State with the Most Legal Casinos 

Nevada reigns as the state with the most legal casinos. With Nevada's gaming industry worth over $10 billion, it is not hard to see why this state tops the list. 

Rounding out the top five states are New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana. These states have a combined total of 116 casinos that offer various forms of gaming. 

Atlantic City is known as the "gambling capital of the world." This city has 11 casinos, which is more than any other city in the United States. 

Las Vegas is probably most well-known for its casinos. The Las Vegas Strip features many large and glamorous casino resorts, including The Venetian, Bellagio, Wynn Las Vegas, and MGM Grand Las Vegas. There are also several off-Strip casinos that are worth checking out. 

If you're looking for a more intimate casino experience, consider visiting one of Pennsylvania's 11 casinos or one of Illinois' 10 casinos. Both of these states have smaller casino resorts that are perfect for a weekend getaway. 

One thing to keep in mind when planning your casino getaway is that not all states allow you to gamble on all games. For example, New Jersey only allows players to bet on blackjack, roulette, and craps at their casinos. Be sure to check out your destination's gambling regulations before making your travel plans!

#  Countries with Legal Casino Gambling 

There are many countries around the world with legal casino gambling. Some of these countries have more casinos than others, while some have strict regulations in place. Let’s take a look at some of the countries with the most casinos as well as those with the most relaxed laws when it comes to casino gambling.

Las Vegas is perhaps the most famous city for casino gambling, but it’s not actually a country. However, there are several countries where casino gambling is legal and thriving. 

The first is Monaco. This small country located on the French Riviera has been a haven for casino gambling since the early 19th century. It’s no surprise that Monaco features so many casinos, as tourism is a major industry here. There are over 30 casinos in Monaco, and they attract millions of visitors every year. 

Another country with a thriving casino industry is Macau. This Special Administrative Region of China has been known for its casino gambling since Portuguese settlers first arrived in the 16th century. These days, Macau has over 40 casinos, and they generate more revenue than any other gaming jurisdiction in the world. 

Next on our list is Singapore. This small Southeast Asian city-state has six licensed casinos, and they attract millions of visitors each year. Singapore is known for its strict laws and regulations when it comes to casino gambling, but that doesn’t seem to be deterring people from visiting these casinos. 

Another country with strict laws when it comes to casino gambling is South Korea. This East Asian country has only five licensed casinos, all of which are located near the border with North Korea. South Koreans are only allowed to gamble in these casinos if they are travelling abroad or if they are residing in one of the special administrative zones near the border. 

Hong Kong is another East Asian country that has relatively restrictive laws when it comes to casino gambling. There are currently only six licensed casinos in Hong Kong, and locals are only allowed to gamble in these venues if they are accompanied by someone from outside of Hong Kong. 

Moving on to Europe, we have Spain. This Mediterranean country has a long history with casino gambling, and there are currently over 100 licensed casinos throughout Spain. Gambling was actually legalized here in 1766, making Spain one of the oldest gaming jurisdictions in the world. 

Another European country with a thriving casino industry is Malta. This small island nation has over 30 licensed casinos, and they generate more revenue than any other gaming jurisdiction in Europe except for Las Vegas Strip properties in America . Malta is known for its relaxed laws when it comes to casino gambling, so it’s no surprise that so many people choose to gamble here. 

Finally, we have Romania. This eastern European country has only four licensed casinos; however, these venues generate more revenue than any other gaming jurisdiction in Romania except for Bucharest . Romania has relatively lax laws when it comes to casino gambling; however, there are some restrictions in place regarding who can gamble and where they can do so.

#  Latest State to Legalize Casino Gambling? Nebraska

The state of Nebraska has been mulling over the idea of legalizing casino gambling within its borders for a few years now. The latest development in the saga comes from a report commissioned by the state that claims casino gambling would bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.

This is, of course, contingent on the state actually legalizing casino gambling. There is still significant opposition to the measure, particularly among conservative lawmakers. But with a projected annual income of $291 million, it’s hard to argue against giving it a try.

In addition to the tax revenue, the report also projects that casino gambling would create more than 2,000 jobs in Nebraska. That could be a major boon to the state, which is currently facing high levels of unemployment.

If casino gambling is legalized in Nebraska, it will join a growing list of states that have taken this step in recent years. Iowa and Missouri both have casinos within their borders, and both states have seen significant economic benefits as a result.

It will be interesting to see if Nebraska follows their lead and legalizes casino gambling as well. The potential benefits are clear, and it’s possible that the state could see an influx of tourism revenue as well. Only time will tell if this happens, but for now, it looks like there’s a good chance that casino gambling will be coming to Nebraska soon.
