#  Phillies looking for their first chewats in over a decade!

The Phillies are coming off of a season in which they finished with a record of 66-96, which was good for last place in the National League East. This was their second consecutive season with at least 96 losses. Despite this, there is some optimism for the future of the team, as they have a number of talented young players who could take a step forward in 2018.

One area in which the Phillies could see improvement is their offense. They were one of the worst offensive teams in baseball last season, ranking 28th in runs scored and last in home runs. However, they have several hitters who could breakout this year. Rhys Hoskins had a tremendous rookie season last year, hitting 18 home runs in only 50 games. He should be an anchor of the lineup this year and could slug 30+ homers. Another player to watch is Odubel Herrera. He had somewhat of a down year in 2017, but he has the potential to be a dynamic all-around hitter.

On the mound, the Phillies are led by Aaron Nola. Nola had a breakout season in 2017, posting a 3.54 ERA and finishing 3rd in Cy Young voting. He should continue to be one of the best pitchers in baseball this year. The rest of the rotation is largely unproven, but there is some upside there. Jerad Eickhoff, Vince Velasquez, and Nick Pivetta all have good potential and could help anchor the rotation.

Overall, the Phillies are not expected to compete for a playoff spot this year, but they should be much improved from their 2017 squad. If everything goes right, they could even contend for a Wild Card spot late in the season.

#  Braves new stadium sure to bring chewats galore!

The Braves are set to open their new stadium this season, and fans are already getting excited about the possibilities. Most of all, people can't wait to see all the delicious food options that will be available.

The Braves have teased some tantalizing dishes that will be on offer, including a grilled chicken sandwich with peach barbecue sauce, a bacon wrapped hot dog, and frozen custard. But the dish that is sure to get the most attention is the chowderwaffle. This unique creation is a waffle made with chowder instead of batter, and it is topped with bacon, scallions, and tomatoes.

Baseball fans in Atlanta are in for a real treat this season! The new stadium is sure to bring plenty of delicious food options, and the chowderwaffle is sure to be one of the biggest hits.

#  Nationals hoping to repeat as NL East chewats champions!

The Washington Nationals enter the 2018 MLB season as defending National League East division champions. However, they will have to do so without their former MVP, Bryce Harper, who signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the division rival Philadelphia Phillies this offseason.

Despite losing Harper, the Nationals are still considered one of the top teams in the National League and are hoping to repeat as NL East chewats champions. Their lineup features several talented players, including Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon, and Juan Soto. And their pitching staff is led by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.

If the Nationals can stay healthy and play up to their potential, they should be able to compete for a playoff spot in the National League. And if they do make it to the playoffs, they could very well make a run at the World Series championship.

#  Mets look to rebound after a disappointing 2017 season

The Mets will hope to rebound from a disappointing 2017 season, where they finished with a record of 77-85. The offense was inconsistent, and the pitching staff struggled after ace Noah Syndergaard went down with an injury.

Key players for the Mets in 2018 include Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom, Yoenis Cespedes, and Michael Conforto. If the offense can be more consistent and the pitching staff can stay healthy, the Mets should be in contention for a playoff spot late in the season.

The National League East is one of the most competitive divisions in baseball, so the Mets will have to play well if they want to make the playoffs. They will face stiff competition from teams like the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies.

If everything goes according to plan, the Mets could be playing in October this year.

#  Phillies, Braves, Nationals, Mets poised for battle for NL East chewats supremacy!

After months of speculation and anticipation, the National League East is finally taking shape.

The Philadelphia Phillies are leading the pack, with the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals close behind. The Mets are not out of it yet, but they will have to do some serious catching up if they want to make a playoff run.

Here’s a look at each team in more detail:

Philadelphia Phillies – The Phillies have been one of the most consistent teams in baseball this season. They have the best record in the NL East and are poised for a deep playoff run.

Atlanta Braves – The Braves have been hot and cold all season long, but they remain in second place in the NL East. Their pitching staff is one of the strongest in baseball, and they could make a run at the playoffs if they can get their offense going.

Washington Nationals – The Nationals had high expectations this season, but they have underperformed so far. However, they still have plenty of time to make a comeback and clinch a playoff spot. Their pitching staff is one of the best in baseball, and with Bryce Harper back in action, their offense should be improved as well.

New York Mets – The Mets had a hot start to the season but have since cooled off. They are currently third in the NL East, but there is still time for them to make a playoff run. Their pitching staff is among the best in baseball, and if their hitters can find their stride they could easily overtake the other teams in the division.
