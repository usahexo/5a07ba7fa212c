#   Dealers Making a Fortune in Guinea-Bissau Blackjack

Casinos have been a big business in many parts of the world for years, generating billions in revenue. In some areas, such as Macau and Las Vegas, casinos are a major part of the economy. But there are other places where gambling is popular but the casinos don’t generate as much income. One such place is Guinea-Bissau.

There are several dealers in the small West African nation making a fortune by running blackjack games. These dealers take advantage of the fact that there is no law against gambling in Guinea-Bissau and they can make a good profit without paying any taxes.

The dealers usually set up their games in hotel rooms or in private homes. They usually require a buy-in of $100 or more and players can lose hundreds or even thousands of dollars in a single game.

The dealers often use sophisticated betting strategies to increase their profits. And because there is no regulation, they can get away with cheating players if they want to.

The authorities in Guinea-Bissau have been aware of the problem for some time, but they have not taken any action because they don’t want to upset the country’s embryonic casino industry.

Some people are calling for the government to license and regulate the dealers so that players can be protected from cheating and overcharging. But others say that would just create another corrupt government bureaucracy that would be difficult to control.

#  Casino Craze Hits West Africa with Blackjack

In a suburb of Lagos, Nigeria, the sounds of slot machines and laughter can be heard spilling out of a nondescript building. This is the first casino to open in Africa's most populous country, and it's not the only one. Casinos are popping up all over West Africa, drawing in players from all walks of life.

The casino craze in West Africa is fueled by a few factors. First, there is a large population of people with disposable income. And second, casinos are seen as glamourous and exciting places to visit. They offer a chance to escape from reality and have some fun.

The games offered in African casinos are similar to those found in casinos all over the world. Blackjack is particularly popular, as is poker. However, there are also some games that are unique to Africa, such as Mancala.

Despite the popularity of casinos in West Africa, there are some who oppose them. Some people see gambling as a form of exploitation that takes advantage of the poor and marginalized. Others argue that gambling can lead to addiction and other negative consequences.

Regardless of these criticisms, it seems unlikely that the casino craze will die down any time soon in West Africa
