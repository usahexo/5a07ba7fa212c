#  Casino Lovers Beware: The Worst Free Slot Machine Apps

Casino lovers beware, the free slot machine apps in the app store are not all they seem. In fact, many of them are just plain terrible.

The first thing you’ll want to do is stay away from any app that has the words “free” or “casino” in the title. These apps are usually nothing more than a ploy to get you to spend money on in-game purchases.

Even if an app doesn’t have those words in the title, be sure to do your research before downloading. There are a lot of fake casino apps out there that look very realistic but will only steal your money.

If you do decide to download an app, be sure to check out the reviews first. The best way to avoid a bad app is to go with one that has been recommended by other users.

Finally, remember that it’s always better to play at a real casino rather than risk your money on a fake one. The experience might not be as convenient, but it’s definitely worth it for the potential rewards.
