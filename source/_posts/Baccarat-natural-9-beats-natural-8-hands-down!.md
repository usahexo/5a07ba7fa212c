#  Baccarat natural 9 beats natural 8 hands down!

There are all sorts of betting games that people can gamble on these days and baccarat is one of the most popular. This game has been around for centuries and there are many different ways to play it, but the basic idea is always the same. Players bet on the outcome of a hand of cards, either choosing to back the Banker or go with the Player.

Some people might think that baccarat is a complicated game, but it’s actually very easy to understand. The aim is to get as close to 9 as possible, and if you go over, the value of your hand is reduced to 0. So, for example, if you have an 8 and a 9, your total would be 17 and therefore reduced down to 7. The Ace is worth 1 point and all other cards are worth their face value.

There are some things that players need to take into account when playing baccarat, though. Firstly, they must decide whether they want to place a ‘stand’ or ‘take’ bet. A stand bet means that the player will not ask for another card, while a take bet means they will elect to draw another card in order to try and get closer to 9. Secondly, players must choose whether they want to back the Banker or the Player – both have an equal chance of winning.

Now that we know how baccarat works, let’s take a look at why the natural 9 hand beats the natural 8 hand every time!

When you have a natural 9 hand in baccarat, this means that your first two cards make up a total of 9. This is automatically higher than any other combination containing an 8 as the lowest score possible in baccarat is still 8 (1 + 7). When you have a natural 8 hand instead, this means your first two cards add up to 8. While this may seem like a good combination, it’s actually not as strong as having a natural 9 hand.

This is because when you have a natural 9 hand, there is only one way for you to lose – if the banker gets a total of 10 or more (since 10 beats both an 8 and 9). With a natural 8 hand instead, there are two ways for you to lose: if the banker gets a total of 10 or more OR if you get dealt another 2-card combination adding up to 8 (e.g. 5 + 3). So even though having an 8 seems like it might be safer than having a 9, actually it’s not!


Baccarat has been around since the 15th century and remains one of the most popular casino games today. While it may seem like a complicated game at first glance, it’s actually very easy to understand – especially once you know why the natural 9 hand always beats the natural 8 hand!

#  Who wins in baccarat: natural 9 or natural 8?

In the baccarat game, there are two possible outcomes for the player: a natural 9 or natural 8. So, who wins in this situation? Essentially, it comes down to a coin flip – the odds are 50/50.

With a natural 9, the player has an immediate advantage because they have already beaten the dealer’s hand. A natural 8 still gives the player a chance to win because the dealer can still go bust. So, in short, it all depends on whether you believe in luck – if you do, go with the natural 9; if you don’t, go with the natural 8!

#  Why natural 9 is better than natural 8 in baccarat

There are several reasons why some people believe that playing with a 9 instead of an 8 gives players a better chance to win at baccarat. The first reason has to do with the house edge. When players bet on the banker, the house edge with an 8 is 1.06%. However, when players bet on the player, the house edge with a 9 is only 0.95%. This small difference may not seem like much, but it can make a big difference in the long run.

Another reason that some people prefer to use a 9 instead of an 8 is because a 9 decreases the chances of a tie happening. When two hands have the same value, this is known as a tie and it results in neither hand winning or losing. With an 8, there is a 50/50 chance of getting a tie, but with a 9, the chances of getting a tie go down to 47.37%. This may not seem like much, but it can make all the difference when playing for real money.

Lastly, some people believe that using a 9 instead of an 8 provides players with a better chance of winning because it gives them more options. For example, if you have an 8 and the dealer has a 2, you can only choose to hit or stand. However, if you have a 9 and the dealer has a 2, you can choose to hit, stand or double down. This extra flexibility can give players an advantage over the house and increase their chances of winning.

#  Baccarat: is natural 9 really better than natural 8?

The debate over whether natural 9 is really better than natural 8 in the game of baccarat has been around for as long as the game has been played. Proponents of natural 9 say that this number is statistically more likely to win, while opponents of this theory say that there is no difference between the two numbers. Let’s take a closer look at the evidence to see which side is right.

First, let’s look at the odds of winning with each number. The odds of winning with a natural 9 are 1 in 10, while the odds of winning with a natural 8 are 1 in 11. This seems to support the argument that natural 9 is better than natural 8, but it’s not quite that simple.

Baccarat is a game of chance, and there are many factors that can influence the outcome. In fact, the odds of winning with either number can vary depending on the particular casino you are playing at. For example, some casinos may offer better odds for natural 9 than for natural 8, while others may offer better odds for natural 8 than for natural 9.

So which number is really better? The answer depends on the individual casino you are playing at. To find out which number offers better odds at your casino, you need to compare the house edge for both numbers. The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep over time.

The house edge for natual 9 is typically around 1.06%, while the house edge for natural 8 is typically around 1.24%. This means that you have a slightly better chance of winning when betting on natural 8 than when betting on natural 9 at most casinos. However, there are some casinos where the house edge for natual 9 is actually lower than for natual 8, so it’s important to do your research before deciding which number to bet on.

#  How to always win in baccarat with the natural 9 strategy

Baccarat is a casino game that is popular with high-rollers and often considered to be a game of chance. However, by using the natural 9 strategy, it is possible to consistently win at baccarat.

The aim of the game is to bet on the hand that you think will be closest to 9. The hands are ranked as follows:

• 2-3-4-5-6 = 0 points
• 7-8-9 = 1 point
• 10-J-Q-K = 0 points
• Aces = 1 point

If both hands are equal, the banker wins. If there is still a tie, the player wins.

To use the natural 9 strategy, simply bet on the hand with the highest number of points. So, for example, if you have a 3 and a 5, you would bet on the 5 because it has more points. If you have two 2s, you would bet on the 2 because it has the lowest number of points. If both hands are equal, then you would bet on the banker’s hand.

The natural 9 strategy is not foolproof, but it does give you a better chance of winning than simply betting on chance alone.
