#  Floating Dragon's Gambling Mechanism a Push

In the past Floating Dragon has been generally used as a Push Mechanism. For those unaware, Floating Dragon is the proclaimed God of Gambling in the Chinese Realm and is used to determine the outcome of many card games and other forms of gambling. The use of Floating Dragon dates back to the era of ChunQiu (Spring and Autumn), more than two thousand years ago.

There are three popular versions of how Floating Dragon is used:

(1) The first method is to draw a lot with black and white beans, with the black bean representing “loss” and the white bean representing “profit”. If you pick the black bean, then you lose and if you pick the white bean, then you win. This method is mainly used in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

(2) The second method involves flipping a coin. If it heads, you lose; tails means you win. This version is mainly used in Mainland China. 
(3) The third method uses three cups: one with water, one with flour paste and one with nothing inside (representing a win). The cups are mixed around and then someone picks one up. If they pick up the cup with water, they lose; if they pick up the cup with flour paste, they win; if they pick up the cup with nothing inside, then it's a draw. This version is mainly used in Korea.

#  Floating Dragon Gambles on Perfect Mechanism

A giant metal dragon, hovering a few dozen feet off the ground, let out a long, low breath. The crowd of onlookers below gasped and stepped back; it seemed to denounce their very existence.

"In place of fuel," the dragon's voice boomed through a loudspeaker hidden in its throat, "I burn only electricity."

The inventor, John Hunter, looked up at his handiwork with pride. It had been years in the making, but now it was complete. The floating dragon was the first of its kind – a true marvel of engineering.

Hunter's invention quickly caught the attention of the gambling community. They were eager to put their money on whether or not the dragon would stay in the air. The odds were initially quite steep, but as word spread about the incredible invention, they began to drop.

The floating dragon had yet to fail and people were starting to believe that it was truly powered by electricity. As the days went on and the dragon remained in the air, people began to think that perhaps there was more to this invention than met the eye…



As night fell on the city, the floating dragon remained in place, illuminated by hundreds of electric lights. People below whispered about what could be next for John Hunter and his incredible invention.

#  Floating Dragon: The Perfect Machine for Gambling?

People have been gambling for centuries, and with good reason. It’s a fun and exciting way to potentially make some money. However, not all gambling options are created equal. Some games, like poker, are more skill-based than others, like slot machines.

If you’re looking for a game that offers a bit more excitement and potential return on your investment, then you may want to try out floating dragon. This game is similar to blackjack, but with an added twist – the dragon itself.

The dragon is a special card that can help or hurt players depending on the circumstances. Overall, the game is fairly simple to learn but offers plenty of opportunity for strategic play. And because it’s a relatively new game, there’s always the chance of encountering a new player who doesn’t know what they’re doing.

One thing to keep in mind when playing floating dragon is that the house edge is relatively high. So if you’re looking to make some serious money, this may not be the game for you. However, if you’re looking for a bit of excitement and don’t want to risk too much money, then floating dragon may be perfect for you!
