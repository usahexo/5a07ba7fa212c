With their wealth of natural resources, they were able to build prosperous communities and even become rivals of the United States. However, by the end of the century their fortunes had taken a turn for the worse.years Osage land had been gradually stolen by white settlers, leaving the tribe with little to their name.</p>
<p>It was then that they turned to an unlikely source of hope: gambling.</p>
<p>The Osage started to play a game called “Big Bamboo” which would soon become the foundation of their economy. The game is similar to blackjack, but with a few important differences. First, players can bet on either the banker or player hand, giving them more control over their odds. Second, a player can choose to “double down” at any time, doubling their bet and giving them another card. Finally, if a player gets 21 with three cards (or less), they automatically win the hand.</p>
<p>This last rule proved to be especially profitable for the Osage. With their tendency to get high scores quickly, they often won hands against the banker—meaning they got paid twice what they originally bet! Soon enough, the tribe had made back all of the land that had been taken from them and more.</p>
<p>The Osage’s success with Big Bamboo has since inspired other native American tribes to adopt the game. Today it remains a popular pastime throughout North America, and has even spread as far as Europe and Asia. So if you’re looking for a chance to make some big money, give Big Bamboo a try!</p>
